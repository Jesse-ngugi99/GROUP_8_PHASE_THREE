    "A telecom business involves the development, ownership or operation of telecommunication systems and services such as mobile communication, fixed-line services, and internet provision to a wide range of customers. Over the years, the telecom business has evolved rapidly because of technology shifts such as adoption of 5G networks, customer expectations, and stiff competition in the field.It can operate in diverse sectors, from software and e-commerce to fintech and biotechnology, but they are all united by a reliance on digital infrastructure and a data-driven approach.The business is often faced by challenges such as customer churn where the clients cancel subscriptions and move to competitors or even fraud cases such as unusual data activities in their sysytems. Due to intense competition in the sector, potential loopholes should be handled with utmost importance and consider decision making based on data-driven insights."
